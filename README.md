- [X] Trivia (Self-scoring)

## Project Description 

My Trivia Game is a web-based game that challenges players with a series of questions from various categories, such as sports, entertainment, history, science, and more. The game has a simple and intuitive interface that allows players to easily navigate through different categories, select answers, and track their score.

Players start the game by choosing a category and then answering a set of multiple-choice questions within a specific time limit. The game will provide instant feedback on each question, indicating whether the answer was correct or incorrect. If the player answers correctly, their score will increase, and they will move on to the next question in the category. If the player answers incorrectly, the game will deduct points, and the player will have to try again.

The game will have a leaderboard that displays the top scores from all players. The player with the highest score will be on top of the leaderboard. The game will also include a timer that counts down the remaining time for each question, adding an extra level of excitement and challenge.
